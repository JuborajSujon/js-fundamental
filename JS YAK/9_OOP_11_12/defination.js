//Introduction to OOP (object oriented programming)

// OOP: Object Oriented Programming
//***  OPP is a programmimg paradigm based on the concept of "Object", which can contain data, in the form of fields (Often known as attributes), and code , in the form of procedures.

// How to think everything as an object?

//*** Everything which takes multiple properties to describe is an object.

//Object properties and method explanation 



//Four pillars of object oriented programming

//1. Abstraction
    //Take a look at abstraction in OOP
    //Abstraction is one of the key concepts of object oriented programming (OOP) languages. Its main goal is to handle complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user, That enables the user to implement more complex logic on top of the provided abstraction with out understanding or even thinking about all the hidden complexity.

//2. Encapsulation
    //Take a look at Encapsulation in OOP
    //Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object oriented programming (OOP). It describes the idea of bunding data and methods that work on that data within one unit.

//3. Inheritance
    //Take a look at Inheritance in OOP
    //Inheritance is one of the core concept of objcet oriented programmimg (OOP) languages. It is mechamism where you can to derivea class from another class for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of attributes and methods.
    
//4. Polymorphism
    //Take a look at Polymorphism in OOP
    //The word Polymorphism is used in various contexts and describes situations in which something occurs in several different types can be accessed through the same interface . Each type can provied its own, independent implementation of this interface. It is one of the core concept of object oriented programmimg (OOP)
